# Hi!I'm Andrew
I am a computer scientist currently in university pursuing my Bachelors computer science. It has really been an amazing journey thus far learning so many new things in school.
I have learnt ore on data structures in C. Also learning on databases and much more to come.

# Front-end development
I have been working with javascript for some time.It was the first language that i learnt back in 2020 during covid and thus decided to delve more into it learning html and css.Finally I took up a framework
(React) in this case and have been making projects with them ever since.As much as i am doing front-end design i am also learning how to work with data.This is because as much as making content is amazing I find 
it more rewarding working with data and getting insights from it.
